Benchmarking 16S clustering methods on low biomass microbiome data

This repo contains the code I'm creating to benchmark selected 16S rRNA clustering and denoising methods on low biomass
microbiome sample data. For now, most of it will be written as bash scripts, with some (e.g., DADA2) implemented in R.
