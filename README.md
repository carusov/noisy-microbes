Benchmarking 16S clustering methods on low biomass microbiome data

This repo contains the code used for the analysis presented in **Performance of microbiome sequence inference methods in environments of varying biomass**. This study benchmarked selected 16S rRNA clustering against newer amplicon sequence variant (ASV) methods on high and low microbial biomass 16S rRNA gene sequencing data.
